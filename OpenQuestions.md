&lt;-   whether it is possible to change the IAM user to Root user

-   even after installing cli in windows I am unable to see it in cmd with aws --version command
-   The specified value for accountAlias is invalid. It must contain only digits, lowercase letters, and hyphens (-), but cannot begin or end with a hyphen
-   I can see 2 policies - Read only Access and View Only Access.... any difference between these 2 policies
-   on cmd its not allowing me to start with" admin$ aws configure"... is there any other way
-   if we forget to copy the access id and keys is there anyway to get it from the console or command prompt
-   I think you skip "security Statement" kind of thing, are you going to cover today or later on?
-   Activate MFA possible only after created IAM user or else can be done on Root User also. which is the best practice
-   security status has option to delete access keys for root user. but when do we get access key when we create account..?
-   if data replicate in different region.. nothing but one region its encrypted and other not .. is that correct
-   whether it is possible to change the IAM user to Root user
-   I need help with cli on Mac. I downloaded everything, still not able to run commands. Also, I am using my personal mac, how do I login as Admin?
-   i am not seeing the Rotate your access keys option in my console
-   Is Public IP changes dynamically every time I restart my system ?
-   As for as I know Natting translates each private IP with single public IP  but you mentioned here like for all private Ip's to one NatIp.>
